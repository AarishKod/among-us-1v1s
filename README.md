# among-us-1v1s
a fun project I have been working on that is written in python and pygame.


Hi, my name is Aarish Kodnaney, I am 13 years old and I love programming in python. if you run this project right now, 
It will simply have a character that you can move around. I want to have two characters, and one character will be the killer, 
and the other will be the surviver. The killer wins if he kills the survivor, the survivor wins if he survives 2 minutes without
being killed. The catch is, the survivor has twice the speed of the killer, but the killer is twice as big as the survivor. 
This is also my first github repo, and I'm really excited to learn more from the wonderful github community. 
P.S, the images in this game aren't mine, so if I'm not supposed to use them on github let me know at aarishkod@gmail.com
